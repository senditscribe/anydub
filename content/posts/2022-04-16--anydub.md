No one likes to be spoken to in a language they don't know unless they're learning that langauge and allowed to ease in comfortably, preferabbly, and most effectively, by immersion.

It may seem like you'd have to be a masochist to want to solve all that with worth that can be as tedious, misunderstood, and unnappreciated as developing.

## Individuals and interactions over processes and tools

The first line of the agile manifesto, maybe sounds strange to start a lesson and repo sharing a bunch of technologies and tools, but valuing individuals and interactions is exactly the natural goal of a CMS. While all of these technologies have strong benefits over other industry comparable options, and even turn their weaknesses into strengths with easy automated builds and staticly generated sites , the netlify jamstack CMS is the most valuable and flexible piece of software being demonstrated. A lightweight, configuration based, react CMS that uses a git repo in lieu of database and for source control is a game changer,

## Technical Documentation

If you are new to coding, it is recommended to follow along with the video walkthough for an in depth explanations and demonstration of the technologies discussed and demonstrated in this code.

This app is built with gatsby, netlify cms, react javascript, node, graphql, netlify jamstack cms, jamstack, and git. Look ma, no database!
