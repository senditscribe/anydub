Fullstack is an IT buzz word that's here to stay. This blog is going to start by teaching fullstack development in a different way, communicating in plain english, teaching by example. The only way to really learn anything in depth is by immersion. Like anything you really want to get good at in life, if you really want to learn to code and develop, you can't pussyfoot, you have to dive in. One of the biggest challenges about coding is figuring out where to begin, what approach to take, because they're are sooo many. Hell, I'm still trying to figure that shit out but, after 15 years, I know most all of them and how we got here at all of them at this point. The solution is having a challenge to focus on that gives it all purpose, something not boring, and worth being immersed in. This blog is also going to be about teaching through demonstration.

## git

For any level of developer, git is the essential tool to connecting to, learning from, and utilizing the world of existing solutions (wheels) at your fingertips. Modern is software is like a car in that it is a construction of multiple parts from multiple manufactures, or developers in this case. Packages are like parts to your car. For most apps, most or almost all of the code deployed is bundled in from existing packages.

## vscode

A developer's IDE is their go to tool in their toolkit. It is our view into our world of code, and being comfortable with and in your IDE is key to enjoying your development experience. They're are lots of really good options, but vscode is a free IDE that revolutionized the free options for cross platform development for any language, but also how IDE are developed and microsoft as a company (future blog post to come)

>[IDE and Code Editor for Software Developers:](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/) A standalone source code editor that runs on Windows, macOS, and Linux. The top pick for Java and web developers, with tons of extensions to support just about any programming language

## terminal (gitbash or wsl on windows)

If you want to learn to code, get used to using the command line. Many of the tools available are command line interfaces (CLI)s that respond to the input of text commands and parameters. Passing text commands and parameters and processing the response is something our applications and ourselves as developers will be doing a lot.

I recommend a mac for coding because it is the developer's swiss army knife. Beyond the fact that they won't let you code for their shit on anything else, mac is unix based, which means you can run linux/unix server applications native through the terminal shell on the mac. Hosting server applications on linux/unix has become so predominant (hosting on Windows in 2022?) that microsoft has added Windows Subsystem of Linux as a feature to Windows (pro...). It's pretty cool, an,,d if you want to develop on Windows, I recommend taking the time to learn it (and find a pro key if you don't have one). If you don't want to go through all that on Windows, I recommend using gitbash, which give you an emulated linux environment on your Windows machine.
