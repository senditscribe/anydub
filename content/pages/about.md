## anydub .. Don't be evil ... c'mon guys, for real, jeez... sory... motto changed, but thanks for making ! ....then at least cut me in!!

anydub is a starter and demo you can follow to get a fast free-o-f-n-cheap-af website up in one hour fast if you own a website domain name. 

Make money off google's robot because it's making money off you. 

## apptain - splainin sum stuff
apptain and is a vlog about building a vlog. 

## apptain - goal

The goal is to teach and learn and to open and grow and share how to open and grow community, many types, but in this context about how to implement these amazing technologies, and into further development and features additions to anydub. I was thinking about splainin whatever I feel like splainin, but if you got some requests or just appreciate me for me tear patreon.

## anydub quick technical explanation
anydub is the best and only functional gatsby 4, netlify cms, and typescript website starter you'll currently find. anydub is a mash up, with a lot of code from  [gatsby-starter-lumen](http://github.com/alxshelepenok/gatsby-starter-lumen), with a jumpstart from @syfxlin/blog, and custom stylized with images inspired from gatsby-calpa-blog along with some other custom feature additions. 

## apptain manifesto - agile manifesto

<h4 align="center">
  Individuals and interactions over processes and tools
</h4>
<sub>so just use the best tools!</sub>
<sub>and don't make a big deal about shit that doesn't have to be a big deal<sub> - with agile

## anydub - apptain - let's make the frikin website already tutorial
If up for following along and installing three development tools, registering for two cloud accounts, and typing along (or copy/pasting but some muscle memory is good) a few commands and changing a few lines of code, then by following this guide, splained in plain english, and in one hour you'll develop your own modern, extensible, online presence with your snazzy dazzy new, free-o-f-n-cheap-af website. So don't be limp or saggy (no one has to know here (; you own your content ;) 

Even if you're not interested in learning anything about code, this guide and the anydub CMS are still for you. Technojargon and geek speak can get annoying to even the most hardcore of us geeks. No one likes to in what sounds like gibberish unless it's your gibberish.  langauge and allowed to ease in comfortably, preferabbly and most effectively by immersing oneself to learning. Just like learning a language, or to make music, or to play sports, the most significant obstacle to learning software development is where to begin. There are just too many solution options, too many programming languages, too many buzz words, too much out out of date documentation online, too many varied professional opinions and recommendations, and too many possible layers in whatever a "fullstack" app is. 

It's seems like you'd have to be a masochist to want to solve all that, and while that's often been true, the goal of anydub and the blog at apptain.com, is to develop, share, present, and teach a CMS to make your life easier and insightful, concise, lessons we can share, and give historical context and share some lessons learned (scars) from some interestng challenges (death marches), and make you happy that now you'd never have to give a shit about any of that. Although there are plenty of birds nest to tangle and wire and detangle and wire, if you have the patience for that sort of thing. If not, no worries though. 

anydub and the apptain blog are different, because we teach by showing, in plain english, with context, and we'll just dive in and immerse into the task of creating and publishing your website. We'll ease into the technical explanations, with some quick definitions, then get right to putting those buzz words to real world use on your bad ass new website. 

## Individuals and interactions over processes and tools
The first line of the agile manifesto, maybe sounds strange to start a lesson and repo sharing a bunch of technologies and tools, but valuing individuals and interactions is exactly the natural goal of a CMS. While all of these technologies have strong benefits over other industry comparable options, and even turn their weaknesses into strengths with easy automated builds and staticly generated sites , the netlify jamstack CMS is the most valuable and flexible piece of software being demonstrated. A lightweight, configuration based, react CMS that uses a git repo in lieu of database and for source control is a game changer, 

## Technical Documentation

If you are new to coding, it is recommended to follow along with the video walkthough for an in depth explanations and demonstration of the technologies discussed and demonstrated in this code.

This app is built with gatsby, netlify cms, react javascript, node, graphql, netlify jamstack cms, jamstack, and git. Look ma, no database!

### anydub custom features

+ One and only current mash up of gatsby 4, netlify cms, with typescript
+ Enhanced styling and design inspired by
    + [gatsby-calpa-blog](http://github.com/alxshelepenok/gatsby-starter-lumen)
+ Capability to render images by remote url incorporating:
    + gatsby-plugin-remote-images
    + gatsby-remark-relative-images
+ Post feed and post page header image display
+ npm package.json start script with concurrent launch of netlify-cms-proxy-server
  (requires port 8001 not in other use)

### anydub todos backlog

+ Finish documentation and cleanup links
+ Modal template, video components, and implementation with modal connecting appealing to blog content read
+ Verify operational or, if necessary, update rss feed to operational
+ Proof of concept automating social media post from anydub rss feed with metricool
+ netlify CMS preview templates functioning
+ Improve css layout and design
+ Link instagram feed to webpage 
+ theme support
+ runtime theme toggling
+ PoC migration to vercel if/when free build/bandwidth limits neared
+ Implement custom netlify CMS widgets
+ Unit test & test coverage eval and demo
+ evaluate lint use and impliment lint with autofix
+ Change from flow to typescript, not that it's better, just more ubiquitous and if we build matching mobile apps, sharing domain object model types in a library could come in handy
+ PoC mdx editor
+ dev environment 
+ componentize anydub to npm package
+ develop yeoman cli npm package for configuring anydub via cli
+ expand domain model for netlify cms data in static/admin/config.yml
